## üß≠ Motivation
Interest rate policy is one of the key tools governments and central banks use to control inflation, stabilize markets, and influence overall economic activity.  
This project aims to explore how **changes in central bank interest rates** affect a variety of **financial and economic indicators** such as stock market indices, bond yields, and sector performance.  
Understanding these relationships helps reveal how monetary policy decisions ripple through the real economy and financial systems.

## üìä Data Sources
This study will use **publicly available datasets** from credible sources:

1. **Interest Rate Data:**  
   - Central Bank of Turkey (TCMB) or Federal Reserve (FRED API)  
   - Variables: policy interest rate, discount rate, date  

2. **Stock Market Indices:**  
   - Yahoo Finance via `yfinance` library  
   - Indices: S&P 500, NASDAQ, BIST 100, and optionally sectoral ETFs (Finance, Tech, Energy)  
   - Variables: closing price, daily/weekly/monthly returns  

3. **Bond Yields:**  
   - U.S. Treasury Yield Curve or Turkish Government Bonds (Kaggle or FRED)  
   - Variables: 2-year and 10-year yields  

4. **Macroeconomic Indicators (optional enrichment):**  
   - World Bank or OECD Data  
   - Variables: GDP growth, inflation rate, unemployment rate

## üß© Data Collection Plan
- Use **Python** with libraries such as `pandas`, `yfinance`, and `requests` to pull and clean data.  
- Align datasets on a **monthly or quarterly** time scale for comparability.  
- Handle missing or irregular data using interpolation and normalization methods.  
- Store cleaned data in a `/data` folder in CSV format.

## üîç Analysis Plan
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualize trends of interest rate vs market indices and bond yields.  
   - Calculate and plot correlation matrices.  
   - Investigate lag effects between policy changes and market responses.

2. **Statistical Testing:**  
   - Conduct hypothesis tests to check whether interest rate changes significantly affect stock indices or bond yields.  
   - Example hypothesis:  
     - H‚ÇÄ: Interest rate changes have no significant effect on market indicators.  
     - H‚ÇÅ: Interest rate changes significantly affect market indicators.

3. **Regression / Machine Learning (later stage):**  
   - Build a **linear regression** or **multiple regression** model to predict stock or bond movements using interest rates and macro variables.  
   - Evaluate model performance using R¬≤ and residual analysis.

## üí° Expected Findings
- Negative correlation between interest rate increases and stock market performance.  
- Positive correlation between interest rates and bond yields.  
- Sector-specific differences ‚Äî financial sectors may show delayed or opposite responses.
