# Project Proposal: The Impact of U.S. Federal Reserve Policy Rate Changes on Financial Markets

## 1. Project Proposal
This project aims to analyze how **changes in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy rate (Federal Funds Rate)** influence major **financial market indicators** such as bond yields, stock market indices, and credit-related variables.  

The purpose is to identify whether monetary tightening (rate hikes) and easing (rate cuts) produce measurable patterns in financial markets.  
By applying data science techniques — including exploratory data analysis and correlation testing — the project will determine the strength and direction of relationships between policy rates and financial variables over time.

## 2. Data to Be Used
All data will be sourced from **institutional and publicly available** databases to ensure reliability and transparency.

| Source | Description | Frequency |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)** | Effective Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS) | Monthly |
| **OECD Data Portal** | U.S. financial and credit market indicators (e.g., lending, financial accounts) | Quarterly |
| **World Bank Global Financial Development Database** | Market capitalization, private sector credit, financial depth ratios | Annual |
| **IMF International Financial Statistics (optional)** | U.S. government bond yields and short-term rates | Monthly |

## 3. Data Collection Plan
I’ll collect the datasets directly from each institution’s website (FRED, OECD, World Bank, and IMF) and download them in CSV or Excel format.  
After that, I’ll organize everything under a common timeline, probably monthly or quarterly, so the data lines up properly.  
If there are any missing values, I’ll fill them in or adjust them depending on the trend.  
Then I’ll pick the variables that matter most for my analysis — mainly the policy rate, bond yields, and financial or credit indicators — and bring them all together into one dataset.  
Once it’s ready, I’ll save the cleaned version in a simple `/data` folder that I can use later for analysis and visualization.
